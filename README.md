# anonuploader-sb
A selfbot that bypasses Discord's 8MB file limit.

# How it works?
- Run `?upload`
- A file picker will pop up, you then choose your file.
- The file will be uploaded and its link will be posted automatically on behalf of your Discord account.

# How to set up?
- Run the software once, it will create a `.env` file.
- Populate your Discord token inside that `.env` file.
- Run the software one more time, and it should now start up.

# WARNING
While this tool is basically harmless, it is not advised to run it on public servers.<br>
It isn't my responsibilty if you get banned.
